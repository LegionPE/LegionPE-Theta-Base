LegionPE open-source framework plugin: LegionPE Theta Base

In order to protect server safety, there is an `**credentials**` line in `.gitignore`. In the real repo, it stores the credentials as constants, like MySQL connection details, IRC webhook paths, etc. In order to make it work with IDEs, I have created [a stub script](/stubs/creden_tials_stub.php) to replace it.

This _Base_ "library" has an abstract class `legionpe\theta\BasePlugin`, which is to be extended by implementations of LegionPE-Theta servers. If you would like to test this "library", please create your own implementation.
